TechAssignment
==============

Using GitHub to create a website for my ArtSci 3B03 -- Technology And Society online assignment!

This is my first time really designing a website so it's certainly not the prettiest thing in the world, but I consider it a solid inaugural effort. 

I used the [Flat UI framework and theme](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/), which is based on [Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com/). Do not fret if you don't know what those things mean, I didn't either before embarking on this project!
