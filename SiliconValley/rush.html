      In the late 1940's, two different phenomena gave rise to Silicon Valley as we know it today (though it did not go by that name until the 1970s).<sup><a href="references.html#2" target="_blank">8</a></sup> The first was party psychological: after the Second World War, many former American infantry members wanted a fresh go at life. After the potentially traumatizing experiences they had overseas, California, what with its then-undeveloped pastures and perfectly temperate sun, seemed like an ideal option. This was especially true for former Navy members who caught a glimpse of this "better life " when passing through the San Francisco Naval Shipyard on their way to the Pacific. It's this demographic that represented the first mass population influx since the '49ers of the Gold Rush days, and they're largely responsible for running many farmers and agriculturalists off the land.

          The second change, and probably the more significant of the two, was a revolutionary discovery by William Shockley's team at Bell Labs in New Jersey in 1948. Shockley, along with fellow researchers John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, designed an entirely novel device known as the <em>transistor</em>, using a type of material called a <em>semiconductor</em> (we'll get into the technical details in a bit).<sup><a href="references.html#6" target="_blank">9</a></sup> The implications for the advance of electronics were widespread and the significance of the transistor was immediately clear. Shockley and his technology were in high demand, most notably by Frederick Terman, who in the '50s served as Dean of the Engineering Department and Provost of Stanford. Terman had also just established Stanford Research Park, a gigantic open-concept plot of farmland which he encouraged students to use for their personal business ventures. HP and Varian Associates were among the first to set up shop in the Research Park.<sup><a href="references.html#2" target="_blank">10</a></sup><br><br><br>

        Then, after receiving a Nobel Prize in 1956, William Shockley decided to pack his bags and move from New Jersey to Mountain View, California. He founded Shockley Semiconductor in Stanford Research Park, and almost singlehandedly launched the technical revolution of the latter 20<sup>th</sup> century. A Nobel Laureate working in Santa Clara Valley gave legitimacy to what was perceived as a culture of students working out of their garages (which, in fairness, did happen with Hewlett and Packard). Tens of thousands of scientists, engineers, and businesspeople followed in Shockley's wake, ushering in the golden age of Silicon Valley.<sup><a href="references.html#9" target="_blank">11</a></sup>
